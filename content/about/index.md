**Jack of all trades, master of none**, they say. From [filmmaking](/projects/kryst4line) to amateur [mashup production](#) to [graphic design](/projects/kryst2line), I've done many things but don't think I ever excelled on any.

Currently working on a retro gaming youtube channel named [Modo7](/projects/modo-7) (Mode 7 in Spanish) and ocasionally making mashups on [kryst2line](/projects/kryst2line) as a side gig.

I'm a **webdev professionally**, although I don't code almost anything outside of my job because it leaves my brain squeezed enough. That's why I tend to make more creative stuff on my free time.

I also love technology since I was a child, so doing **console mods and tinkering with fun devices** is totally my vibe.
