After putting on hiatus an old gaming channel for personal reasons, I wanted to move from there to try a new format that let me express more my creativity: Vlogging.

Even though in the end I stopped making vlogs for a lack of interesting (and related) content to put, I got to learn a lot about filmmaking, edition and pacing. I'd love to continue someday, but right now it seems unlikely.
